        This is a simple implementation of relif algorithm which used for feature
        selections, the relif is simple to understand and high performance, but it
        can only deal with binary classification.

        Pay attention: relif use random sample selection of same class rather than
        using nearest neighbor sample to calculate nearest hit and miss, and it use
        number or string to make difference between named variable and numeric variable.
        it cannot handle null data, it will be improved later.
